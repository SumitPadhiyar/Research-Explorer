## TODO

~~1. Implement queries~~ Testing pending
2. Show results of PaperRank separately in three tables (papers, authors and venues)
3. Show comparison of results of naive queries against PaperRank.
4. Plot graph of execution time with increasing data size.
5. Figure out a better model to compute rank.
